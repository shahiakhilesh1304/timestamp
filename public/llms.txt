# Timestamp

> A customizable time tracking web app with countdowns, timers, and world clocks featuring multiple visual themes and instant URL sharing. Built with TypeScript, vanilla JavaScript, and progressive web app capabilities.

Key features:
- Three countdown modes: Local Time (wall clock per timezone), Same Moment (absolute UTC instant), and Timer (fixed duration)
- Multiple visual themes with animated canvas effects (contribution graph, fireworks, etc.)
- Instant URL sharing - every countdown configuration generates a shareable URL
- World map with real-time day/night visualization
- Full PWA support with offline capabilities
- Comprehensive accessibility support including screen readers and reduced motion

Architecture:
- Modular orchestrator pattern coordinating theme lifecycle and state
- Plugin-based theme system with registry-driven configuration
- TypeScript with strict type checking and path aliases
- Comprehensive test coverage (Vitest unit tests + Playwright E2E)

## Common Questions

**How do the countdown modes differ?**
- Local Time: Counts to a date in each viewer's timezone (e.g., New Year's Eve - each timezone celebrates separately)
- Same Moment: Everyone counts to the same UTC instant (e.g., product launches - everyone sees the same countdown)
- Timer: Fixed duration countdown starting when opened (e.g., Pomodoro sessions)

**How do I share a countdown?**
Every configuration generates a shareable URL automatically. Just copy the browser URL or use the Share button.

**Does it work offline?**
Yes! As a PWA, Timestamp works offline after your first visit. Install it from your browser for the best experience.

**Can I create a theme?**
Absolutely! Use `npm run theme create <name>` to scaffold a new theme. See the Theme Development Guide for details.
